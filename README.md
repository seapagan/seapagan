# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?

**Grant Ramsay**, also known as '**Seapagan**'. Coder, Dev-ops, Full-Stack
developer and unashamed Trekkie (Star Gate was also pretty cool. Discovery sucks
donkey balls).

I have been programming in one form or other since I was 10 (ZX81 BASIC FTW),
which is over 40 years of wrist strain and no dates.

For 27 years of this time I also had an amazing life and career in the offshore
Oil and Gas Industry working on (and then running) Seismic Survey Ships,
traveling almost the whole world and finding new and unique local customs to be
arrested for breaking, usually while imbibing new and unique local alcohol.

Those days are way past now and I have returned to coding as a way of life. I am
fascinated with new technologies and continuously want to learn more and more.

My current languages of choice are Python, HTML/CSS etc, Javascript
(specifically React though I also perversely enjoy vanilla JS) and Ruby.

Visit my [Portfolio page][porto] and my [Projects
page][projects] for more insights! I'm also trying (badly) to resurrect my old
blog [Tek:Cited][tekcited] though the going is slow....
