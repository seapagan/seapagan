# Hi there 👋

## Who am I?

Grant Ramsay, also known as 'Seapagan'. Coder, Full-Stack developer and unashamed
Trekie (Star Gate was alos pretty cool. Discovery sucks donkey balls).

I have been programming in one form or other since I was 10 (ZX81 BASIC WTF),
which is over 40 years of wrist strain and no dates.

During this I also had an amazing life and career in the offshore Oil and Gas
Industry, travelling almost the whole world and finding new and unique local
customs to be arrested for breaking.

Visit my [Portfolio page][porto] and my [Projects
page][projects] for more insights! I'm also trying (badly) to resurrect my old
blog [Tek:Cited][tekcited] though the going is slow....
