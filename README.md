# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?

**Grant Ramsay**, also known as '**Seapagan**'. Coder, Dev-ops, Full-Stack
developer and unashamed Trekkie (Star Gate was also pretty cool. Discovery sucks
donkey balls).

I have been programming in one form or other since I was 10 (ZX81 BASIC FTW),
which is over 40 years of wrist strain and no dates.

For 27 years of this time I also had an amazing life and career in the offshore
Oil and Gas Industry working on (and then running) [Seismic Survey Ships][mss],
traveling almost the whole world and finding new and unique local customs to be
arrested for breaking, usually while imbibing new and unique local alcohol. I
was a [Doodlebugger][db], it's a lifestyle not a job.

Those days are way past now and I have returned to coding as a way of life. I am
fascinated with new technologies and continuously want to learn more and more.

My current languages of choice are Python, HTML/CSS etc, Javascript
(specifically React though I also perversely enjoy vanilla JS) and Ruby.

I'm also trying to improve my Frontend skills using the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges.
These will be stored in a GitHub Organization I created specifically for this purpose, to keep the noise down in my main account. Find them [here](https://github.com/seapagan-fem). There are still a couple in this account I need to transfer over.

Visit my [Portfolio page][porto] and my [Projects
page][projects] for more insights! I'm also trying (badly) to resurrect my old
blog [Tek:Cited][tekcited] though the going is slow....
